<a id="smarthome" class="anchor" href="#smarthome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SmartHome</h1>

<p>This is the repo of my project  for CS6600.</p>

<p>In this project, I am mainly focus&gt; ing on how to make a thermostat aware of the user. This can be achieved by providing the thermostat the location of the user via his phone. Also, the thermostat can know the schedule of the user in advance via the Google Calendar. Once we have all this data, system can also predict the current energy usage by the user.The user can set the location of his home, which is stored on the Parse.com. Parse.com is being used as the BaaS(Backend as a Service).<br>
Once the user sets the location of the house, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">Geofence</a> is created for this location. Whenever the user enters/exists this geofence, an event is triggered which lets the thermostat know that user has left the location.</p>

<a id="what-does-the-project-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-the-project-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does the project do?</h1>

<p>This project is mainly used for two things -</p>

<ol>
<li>To provide users location to the system.<br>
</li>
<li>To provide users schedule to the System from the Google Calendar.</li>
</ol>

<p>This can then be used to provide the user with current energy usage.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/state_briefs/images/arizona_pdf.png" alt="">  </p>

<p>Seeing the graphs from the above figure, it can be seen that Space heating with 41% is the largest consumer of energy when it comes to residential energy consumption.</p>

<p>Mobile phones are now an important part of ones life, thus can be used to get info about the user at all times.</p>

<p>By knowing the location and schedule of the user, the system can predict  better energy usage patterns by the user. Thus, helping the user in saving energy.</p>

<p>The thermostat can shut down the heating system when the user is not at home.</p>

<h1>
<a id="how-will-it-be-done" class="anchor" href="#how-will-it-be-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will it be done?</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Location:-</p>

<p>The location of the user can be accessed via the users phone. I have used Google Location API to do this.  </p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11513549/1e638cbe-9831-11e5-8fbe-f11277d8bf61.jpg" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schedule:-</p>

<p>The schedule is taken from Google Calendar. To access Google Calendar, I have used Google Calendar API. The location and<br>
time of the event can be extracted from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weather:-</p>

<p>I have used the API provided by <a href="http://forecast.io/#/f/41.7511,-111.8048">forecast.io</a> to provide the details like<br>
temperature, sky cover, precipitation. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h1>

<p>This project uses resources from:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Google location API.<br>
</li>
<li>Google Calendar API.<br>
</li>
<li>Parse as BaaS.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.androidhive.info/2015/02/android-location-api-using-google-play-services/">http://www.androidhive.info/2015/02/android-location-api-using-google-play-services/</a><br>
</li>
<li>API from forecast.io.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Technology used:-  </p>

<ol>
<li>Android application is being used to get the location and schedule.<br>
</li>
<li>Python is being used to scrap the web and provide the backend support.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://limitless-river-4923.herokuapp.com/">Link</a> to python code hosted on Heroku. Basically, it is the scrapped<br>
weather data from the web.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This diagram shows all the parameters that are required by the system to make the decision.  </p>

<h1>
<a id="database-view" class="anchor" href="#database-view" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DataBase View</h1>

<p>This is the database to store the users.  </p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11384759/ee87c106-92cf-11e5-9de8-f0eae3aa4bcc.png" alt="">  </p>

<p>This is the database to store the location of the house of the user. The objectId of User table corresponds to the parent column in the HomeLocation table. This creates a relation between two databases.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11384771/02ea17b6-92d0-11e5-9e0e-48dd79aaf1ea.png" alt=""></p>

<h1>
<a id="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Work</h1>

<p>I look forward to integrate this system with a thermostat and have a coherent system that is capable of adapting to the daily life of the user. Also, make the system more energy efficient and provide the user with a feedback of his current energy usage. </p>
