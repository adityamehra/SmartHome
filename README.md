# SmartHome
This is the repo of my project  for CS6600.

#What?
This project is mainly used to provide a feed of users location to the server. 
It also has some functionality via user can interact and know the status of the system.

#Why?
Mobile phones are now inseperable part of ones life, thus can be used to get info about the user a all times.
In ths way we can reduce the energy consumption if we are able to predict when the user is away from the house and 
thermostat can shut down.
