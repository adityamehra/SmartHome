{"name":"SmartHome","tagline":"Things to hep you attend your life in simple, better and efficient ways.","body":"# SmartHome\r\nThis is the repo of my project  for CS6600.\r\n\r\nIn this project, I am mainly focus> ing on how to make a thermostat aware of the user. This can be achieved by providing the thermostat the location of the user via his phone. Also, the thermostat can know the schedule of the user in advance via the Google Calendar. Once we have all this data, system can also predict the current energy usage by the user.The user can set the location of his home, which is stored on the Parse.com. Parse.com is being used as the BaaS(Backend as a Service).   \r\nOnce the user sets the location of the house, a [Geofence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence) is created for this location. Whenever the user enters/exists this geofence, an event is triggered which lets the thermostat know that user has left the location.\r\n\r\n#What?\r\nThis project is mainly used for two things -\r\n\r\n1. To provide users location to the system.  \r\n2. To provide users schedule to the System from the Google Calendar.\r\n\r\nThis can then be used to provide the user with current energy usage.\r\n\r\n#Why?\r\nMobile phones are now an important part of ones life, thus can be used to get info about the user at all times.\r\n\r\nBy knowing the location and schedule of the user, the system can predict  better energy usage patterns by the user. Thus, helping the user in saving energy.\r\n\r\nThe thermostat can shut down the heating system when the user is not at home.\r\n\r\n#How?\r\n\r\n1. Location:-\r\n\r\n  The location of the user can be accessed via the users phone. I have used Google Location API to do this.\r\n  \r\n2. Schedule:-\r\n\r\n  The schedule is taken from Google Calendar. To access Google Calendar, I have used Google Calendar API. The location and         \r\n  time of the event can be extracted from there.\r\n\r\n3. Weather:-\r\n\r\n  I have used the API provided by [forecast.io](http://forecast.io/#/f/41.7511,-111.8048) to provide the details like        \r\n  temperature, sky cover, precipitation. \r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\nThis project uses resources from:-\r\n\r\n1. Google location API.  \r\n2. Google Calendar API.  \r\n3. Parse as BaaS.  \r\n4. http://www.androidhive.info/2015/02/android-location-api-using-google-play-services/  \r\n5. API from forecast.io. \r\n\r\n#System Overview\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11383919/cce14c9a-92c8-11e5-809c-59055c05450f.png)\r\n\r\n#DataBase View\r\n\r\nThis is the database to store the users.  \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11384759/ee87c106-92cf-11e5-9de8-f0eae3aa4bcc.png)  \r\n  \r\nThis is the database to store the location of the house of the user. The objectId of User table corresponds to the parent column in the HomeLocation table. This creates a relation between two databases.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478122/11384771/02ea17b6-92d0-11e5-9e0e-48dd79aaf1ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
